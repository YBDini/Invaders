CHECKLIST:

!!Things, such as the boss and the blocks only show up when you manually set the values to that stage in main and in 
!! startup find a way to solve this and then carry on because that will make the transitions between stages and levels
!! seamless
- Create FIRE coming out of the engine for the players and the enemies

- Enemies can't shoot in the LANE if a CIVILIAN is in that lane... ORRRRRRRRR Enemies can shoot in that lane
but the civilian doesn't take any damage

- Create the code for a town in which the player gets out of their spaceCraft
and travels around the really small town TOWN 1

- Create TOWN 2

- Create TOWN 3

- Create TOWN 4

- Maybe in each town you could create a HANGOUT spot in which npc's could relay riddles to you and you 
answer in a way that you would solve that riddle, maybe like a interactive puzzles that pop up on the screen
or just text puzzles that you just think through.

- Design a way for the spawner to only SPAWN things that objects aren't in a specific LANE
except for the player, this will make sure that a civilian and an enemy wont
spawn on top of each other. Maybe if the entity is above a certain y point
then nothing will spawn in that lane

- Find a appropriate SPAWNING rate that is neither too easy nor too hard.
Take into consideration the size of the screen, things can't move too fast 
or things may overwhelm the player, nor too slow to bore them.

- Create a HOTEL - Will fully restore the player's health and fill up their
ship's "juice"

- Create a "JUICE" meter. This will represent how much light energy you can use to shoot enemies
and shoot beams etc. Your ammo.

- Create a restaraunt - You can buy snacks and foods here. Each city will have a certain type of style for
food, like some is just goop and others are extremely spicy food, etc.

- GLOSSARY for all of the Objects in the game - gives lore to the game, something you can really put some
attention into once you are finished the game and really just debugging
(find out how to fix the bug in the glossary where it just wont show... it just
shows a black screen...)

- MUSIC PLAYER for your space craft. Think of the space craft as a super advanced car. You can switch what 
type of music you are listening to whether you are in game or in the startup menu

- Create Boss2

- Create Boss3

- Create FinalBoss

-find out how to successful CONNECT the game's stages and levels so that it's seamless
and doesn't break

-find out how to make it when you press the space bar when the text is not done going

again will make the process continue.
